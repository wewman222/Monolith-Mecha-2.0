    Quick Explanation in 3 easy steps: 3 items needed, all available in the BarristaVend,

        - Tea Bag of choice
        - Liquid Container
        - Heat Plate

    Step 1. Measurements.

        Each 1u of tea powder is 5u of drink, and the powder is consumed upon drink creation.

        You can either pour 5u of it directly from the bag, or use a Tea Spoon to move 1u measurements.

        Normal non-decaff coffee does not fall under this category and uses a different recipy.

    Step 2. Boil Water and add Powder

        Put the water boiling for 20-30 seconds on the Heat Plate. Then, add appropriate ammount of Tea Powder, a chemical mixing sound being heard if done correctly.

        Alternatively powder and water can be put on the hot plate together for quicker tea.

    Step 3. Enjoy!

        Your tea should be ready! If you put too much powder, and if the container is straight off the Heat Plate alongside has space, you can add water and tea will keep mixing."
